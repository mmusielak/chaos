# Chaos and Fractals

Let's say we have three vertices defining a triangle and a point in random location within that triangle. Now let's play a game: pick a random vertex and jump half way towards it. Draw a pixel. Repeat the process.

Soon a pattern will start to emerge. 


## Running

If you want to make any changes you can run `npm install` and `npm start` will initiate a dev server with hot reload. Otherwise you can simply open `index.html` from `dist` folder and use arrow keys to switch between modes.
