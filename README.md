## Running

Currently you have to go the the **init** section (somewhere around ine 150) and select one of the modes:

- **tri**
- **fern**
- **ngon**

If you choose **ngon** you can make few adjustments: 
*neighbours* if set to false skips neighbouring nodes resulting in some interesting patterns 
*different* if set to true forces algo to pick different node than the last that was selected previously

Just make your adjustments and refresh the page.
